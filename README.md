Originally planned to be programmed in Ruby, it will now be programmed in C# and be available for Windows only. Sorry, Linux and OS X users.

Current development status is undetermined. It'll come soon, but probably not for a while.

**Note:** When rScanner is at that point where you have a basic interface and can't do much, it will be uploaded to GitHub, released^1 as a pre-release, and README.md will be replaced with README-new.md.
