# ROBLOX Asset Scanner
As the name suggests, ROBLOX Asset Scanner is a GUI program modelled after oozlescan by [@oozledoodles](http://twitter.com/oozledoodles) that scans http://roblox.com/ for when a new item is published to the website and alerts the user when an item is published by [ROBLOX](http://roblox.com/user.aspx?id=1), the 'system' account used to publish official items to the [ROBLOX Catalog](http://roblox.com/Catalog).
