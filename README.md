![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.0-red.svg)

As the name suggests, ROBLOX Asset Scanner is a GUI program modelled after oozlescan by [@oozledoodles](http://twitter.com/oozledoodles) that scans http://roblox.com/ for when a new item is published to the website and alerts the user when an item is uploaded by [ROBLOX](http://roblox.com/user.aspx?id=1), the 'system' account used to publish official items to the [ROBLOX Catalog](http://roblox.com/Catalog).

In addition to scanning the ROBLOX Catalog for new items, ROBLOX Asset Scanner comes with more features such as...

* **Auto-tweet functionality** - Automatically tweets newly uploaded assets to your Twitter account. Mainly implemented for [@LeakBLOX](https://twitter.com/LeakBLOX) by [@Brassrhino](http://twitter.com/Brassrhino) <3.
* **GUI Interface** - oozlescan is made using the [LÃ–VE 2D Game Engine](https://love2d.org/) and uses an interface similar to a [Command-line Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). ROBLOX Asset Scanner uses a purely [Graphical User Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) for easy use.
