rScanner is a GUI program modeled after oozlescan by [@oozledoodles](http://twitter.com/oozledoodles). rScanner scans http://roblox.com/ for new items that are published to the website and alerts the user when an item is uploaded by [ROBLOX](http://roblox.com/user.aspx?id=1), the main administrative account used to publish official items to the [ROBLOX Catalog](http://roblox.com/Catalog).

rScanner comes with extra features such as:

* **Auto-tweet functionality** - Automatically tweets newly uploaded assets to your Twitter account. Mainly implemented for [@LeakBLOX](https://twitter.com/LeakBLOX) by [@Brassrhino](http://twitter.com/Brassrhino) <3.
* **GUI Interface** - oozlescan is made using the [LÖVE 2D Game Engine](https://love2d.org/) and uses an interface similar to a [Command-line Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). rScanner uses a purely [Graphical User Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) for easy use.
* **Update Notifier** - There's millions of programs on the Internet. Most of them don't provide you with ways of knowing when to update the program. However, rScanner will. If an update is available, you will be notified the next time you open rScanner with a link to the latest download file.
